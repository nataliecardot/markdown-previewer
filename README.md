This simple app allows you to preview Markdown as it's typed.

It was built using React (including React [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)) and React Boostrap.

### View locally
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Using a command line tool, navigate to the directory's location
3. Run `npm install`, which installs all modules listed as dependencies in `package.json`.
4. Run `npm start` to run the app in development mode, opening the app in your default browser. (The command causes node to look for a `scripts` object in your `package.json` file, which in this case specifies "react-scripts start."). You also may open the app on the local server by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

### Notes

Markdown is parsed with [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked).

This app was built using React. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
